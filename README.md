# N64ControllerOcarina
Ever wanted to play the Ocarina of Time without the N64?


This code can be run on an Arduino Uno or theoretically any ATmega328*.

Follow the [base guide from quasse on instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Use-an-Arduino-with-an-N64-controller/) for wiring the N64 Controller to the Arduino, then put your speaker on Pin 8 and Ground.

Have fun!
